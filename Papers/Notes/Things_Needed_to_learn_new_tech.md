### Things needed to learn a new technology

1. Decide on a goal or project
    - stopping at "I'm going to learn AWS" won't take you nearly as far as someone with a clear reason for learning it.
    - deciding on a goal or project brings *focus*
    - with a project, your brain will seek things relate to it
2. Read until you understand "How to Think" about it
    - Understanding the 50,000 ft view
        - For example, when I was getting into DevOps and automation, my 50,000 ft view was this: all I'm doing is figuring out what steps I'd need to take manually, scripting them, and then setting up something to manage and execute those scripts.
    - how do you find this 50,000 ft view?
        - Read a handful of introductory articles from independent contributors 
3. Read for awareness
    - It's at this point that I'll dive into a textbook or documentation
    - seeking to acquire is AWARENESS of this technology's capabilities and what can be done with it
        - I might not know exactly how to use them, but that's not the point right now.
    - Go to the documentation, or whatever textbook, and read it like a novel.
    - Remember, you don't have to memorize anything at this point but you DO need to process it.
4. Build for learning
    - Now is the time to build. Not to take multiple choice tests. Not to get stuck in reading even more. Build.
    -  this process of building that takes the gaseous knowledge you've acquired and turns it solid
    - first, you start mixing in all of the various learnings styles in context of an active process
        - If there's one way to ensure that information sticks, it's to associate an emotion with it.
            - the accomplishment of getting through something
            - the absolute devastation of dealing with a bug for hours that turns out to be a typo
            - those are the types of events that will take your learning to a different level.
    - second, the sheer repetition of actions is, of course, necessary in any type of skill
    - third, you'll encounter edge cases, bugs, and nuanced details that will test your understanding and extend your capabilities.
        - being able to deal with these issues will give you a massive speed boost in future projects.
    - fourth, since you've hopefully picked a project that isn't a cake walk, you've given yourself a reference for the future   
5. Repeat, lightly memorize
    - Find another goal / project.
    - Expand your compass and intuition by looking through what others have done
    - repetition will create the lightly memorize 
6. Teach it
    - The truest test of your understanding is how well you can impart your knowledge upon another person...and them actually understand it
    - Any old fool can get up and spout terminology, step-by-steps, and unintentional hyperbole
    - One of my favorite economists is Alfred Marshall for this reason. Though most of the Economics community during his time was obsessed with mathematics, he held that it should only be a part of it. His full quote:
        1. Use mathematics as shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. 
        2. Keep to them till you have done. 
        3. Translate into English. 
        4. Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. 
        5. Burn the mathematics. 
        6. If you can't succeed in 4, burn 3. This I do often."
    -  Being able to output it in real terms requires a very deep understanding of the topic.
